Justin Duane Talley
Hiring Manager — Technical Manager (Job ID 3940)
Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies
Kansas City National Security Campus
14520 Botts Road, Kansas City, MO 64147

Dear Mr. Talley,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Technical Manager position (Job ID 3940, E09/B55). As a current Senior Electrical Engineer at Honeywell FM&T with an active DOE Q Security Clearance with SCI, I've spent nearly six years embedded in this mission — leading pulse power programs, driving R&D from concept through delivery, and building the people and processes that make this campus effective. I understand what it means to work inside a national asset responsible for proliferation deterrence, supply chain assurance, and responsiveness to global threats. This role is the next step in a trajectory I've been deliberately building, and I'm ready.

## Why This Role Fits

The posting describes exactly what I do now — and what I want to do at scale. You need someone who develops vision and strategy to support mission objectives: improving quality, reducing flowtime, improving productivity, and enhancing operational surety. That's not aspirational language for me. My core competencies table is organized around those exact four pillars because that's how I already think about the work.

## Budget, Staffing & Resource Forecasting

I've orchestrated **many millions** of dollars in project execution across the pulse power portfolio — personally developing or supporting staffing plans, budget proposals, and resource forecasts for each effort. As a full cost recovery operation, I've developed a keen understanding of how long tasks actually take and how difficult they are in real execution. That takes nuance: understanding the local team, people's strengths, and the customer's true needs. I proactively re-baseline resource forecasts when actuals diverge from plan, because accurate financial reporting sustains sponsor confidence — and sponsor confidence sustains the mission.

## Building & Developing People

At the core of technical management is building people, and that's where I invest the most energy. I've developed technical talent by cross-training **7 teammates** for critical program roles — designing curriculum, justifying budget allocations, and holding individuals accountable to committed objectives. I served as technical lead for a **significant six-figure** bi-annual training program, managing both direct and matrixed personnel — coordinating **50+ internal participants** and up to **10 executive-level sponsors** per year through planning, assigning, and directing work.

The posting says this role will be "building a growing team." That's exactly what I do now — I continuously identify and pull in new or external engineers to support constrained missions, match individuals with the right programs and mentors, and ensure growth at a pace they're comfortable with. I also identify alternate resources in advance to fill anticipated gaps in rapid prototype work, because succession planning isn't something that happens once a year — it's a daily discipline.

## Credentials & Technical Depth

I bring the foundation this role requires:

- **B.S. Electrical Engineering** (Cum Laude, ABET) — Missouri S&T
- **MBA, 4.0 GPA** — Missouri S&T
- **DFSS Green Belt** (Lean Six Sigma) — applied directly to R&D that produced **2 patent disclosures** in Li-Fi technology and successive work that led to a major expansion in Li-Fi R&D
- **Active DOE Q + SCI** — no clearance processing delay
- **7+ years** of continuous engineering experience as a U.S. Citizen

On the "We Value" items: I have hands-on experience with statistical process control, quality metrics, and data-driven decision-making through my work managing program execution and total quality assurance. I'm actively building capability in data analytics and AI/ML — I maintain a professional-grade home lab where I develop with embedded AI platforms, agentic AI workflows, and sensor fusion systems. I approach new toolsets the way I approach everything: get in the trenches, learn by doing, and build real competency fast.

## Leadership Philosophy

My philosophy is simple. I lead from the front as a servant leader — I practice what I preach, maintain a higher standard because of my position, and focus on tearing down barriers so my people can do their best work. Metrics serve the team, not the other way around. I use data to identify obstacles and allocate resources, not to assign blame. Accountability means giving people what they need to succeed, then holding them to the standard.

I've carried this philosophy from a platoon of 22 soldiers and a section of 8 technicians in the Army, through the extreme industrial environments of Nucor Steel, and into the pulse power programs I lead today. The setting changes. The standard doesn't.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with the needs of your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
