Justin Duane Talley
Hiring Manager — Technical Manager (Job ID 3940)
Honeywell Federal Manufacturing & Technologies
Kansas City National Security Campus
14520 Botts Road, Kansas City, MO 64147

Dear Mr. Talley,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Technical Manager position (Job ID 3940, E09/B55). As a current Senior Electrical Engineer at Honeywell FM&T with an active DOE Q Security Clearance with SCI, I've spent nearly six years embedded in this mission — leading pulse power programs, driving R&D from concept through delivery, and building the people and processes that make this campus effective. I understand what it means to work inside a national asset responsible for proliferation deterrence, supply chain assurance, and responsiveness to global threats. This role is the next step in a trajectory I've been deliberately building, and I'm ready.

## Why This Role Fits

The posting describes exactly what I do now — and what I want to do at scale. You need someone who develops vision and strategy to support mission objectives: improving quality, reducing flowtime, improving productivity, and enhancing operational surety. That's not aspirational language for me. My core competencies table is organized around those exact four pillars because that's how I already think about the work.

## Budget, Staffing & Resource Forecasting

I've orchestrated **many millions** of dollars in project execution across the pulse power portfolio — personally developing or supporting staffing plans, budget proposals, and resource forecasts for each effort. As a full cost recovery operation, I've developed a keen understanding of how long tasks actually take and how difficult they are in real execution. That takes nuance: understanding the local team, people's strengths, and the customer's true needs. I proactively re-baseline resource forecasts when actuals diverge from plan, because accurate financial reporting sustains sponsor confidence — and sponsor confidence sustains the mission.

## Building & Developing People

At the core of technical management is building people, and that's where I invest the most energy. I've developed technical talent by cross-training **7 teammates** for critical program roles — designing curriculum, justifying budget allocations, and holding individuals accountable to committed objectives. I served as technical lead for a **significant six-figure** bi-annual training program, managing both direct and matrixed personnel — coordinating **50+ internal participants** and up to **10 executive-level sponsors** per year through planning, assigning, and directing work.

The posting says this role will be "building a growing team." That's exactly what I do now — I continuously identify and pull in new or external engineers to support constrained missions, match individuals with the right programs and mentors, and ensure growth at a pace they're comfortable with. I also identify alternate resources in advance to fill anticipated gaps in rapid prototype work, because succession planning isn't something that happens once a year — it's a daily discipline.

## Credentials & Technical Depth

I bring the foundation this role requires:

- **B.S. Electrical Engineering** (Cum Laude, ABET) — Missouri S&T
- **MBA, 4.0 GPA** — Missouri S&T
- **DFSS Green Belt** (Lean Six Sigma) — applied directly to R&D that produced **2 patent disclosures** in Li-Fi technology and successive work that led to a major expansion in Li-Fi R&D
- **Active DOE Q + SCI** — no clearance processing delay
- **7+ years** of continuous engineering experience as a U.S. Citizen

On the "We Value" items: I have hands-on experience with statistical process control, quality metrics, and data-driven decision-making through my work managing program execution and total quality assurance. I'm actively building deep capability in data analytics and AI/ML, and I'll speak to that directly.

## AI, Data & the Path Forward

I've become deeply invested in AI — not as a trend to follow, but as an engineering discipline to master. On my own time, I've built a professional-grade home lab and worked nonstop across the full AI stack: edge AI on microcontrollers, large language models, agentic AI workflows, local inference infrastructure, and n8n automation pipelines integrating multiple LLMs. I've built legitimate tools that have shown me what the future looks like when these capabilities are applied correctly — and more importantly, what it looks like when they're not.

I've seen firsthand the challenges of bringing AI into KCNSC and the broader NNSA enterprise. There is real work to be done to define a path forward that is both safe and effective — one that respects the security and compliance environment we operate in while ensuring we can compete with near-peer adversaries and maintain our edge as the most capable national security engineering operation in the world. I want to be part of building that path, and I believe a technical management role — where I can shape both the people and the strategy — is where I can have the most impact.

## Why Management, and Why Now

I've been deliberate about this transition. I'm proud of the technical work I've done — the patents, the QRCs, the R&D — and I'll always be an engineer at heart. My home lab ensures I stay connected to the technical challenges my team will face daily, which I consider a direct asset to management, not a departure from it.

But the truth is, I've always been drawn to the people side of the work. Leading a platoon, running a training program for 50+ personnel, mentoring junior engineers through high-pressure deliveries — that's where I come alive. I have a knack for understanding what individuals need, matching them to the right work, and building an environment where they can grow. With a growing family and a deepening commitment to this mission, the timing is right to fully invest in what I do best: developing a team that accomplishes together what no individual can alone.

The demanding programs I've navigated at Honeywell have given me hard-won lessons about how teams succeed and where they break down. Those lessons drive my commitment to doing it better — to building a culture where people work together toward the cutting edge and the future, not just the next deliverable.

## Leadership Philosophy

My philosophy is simple. I lead from the front as a servant leader — I practice what I preach, maintain a higher standard because of my position, and focus on tearing down barriers so my people can do their best work. Metrics serve the team, not the other way around. I use data to identify obstacles and allocate resources, not to assign blame. Accountability means giving people what they need to succeed, then holding them to the standard.

I've carried this philosophy from a platoon of 22 soldiers and a section of 8 technicians in the Army, through the extreme industrial environments of Nucor Steel, and into the pulse power programs I lead today. The setting changes. The standard doesn't.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with the needs of your team. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,
